Malcolm provides an instance of [CyberChef](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef), which describes itself as the "Cyber Swiss Army Knife - a web app for encryption, encoding, compression and data analysis." CyberChef is available at at **https://localhost/cyberchef.html** if connecting locally.

Arkime's [Sessions](arkime.md#ArkimeSessions) view has built-in CyberChef integration for Arkime sessions with full PCAP payloads available: expanding a session and opening the **Packet Options** drop-down menu in its payload section will provide options for **Open src packets with CyberChef** and **Open dst packets with CyberChef**.
