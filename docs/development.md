## <a name="Build"></a>Building from source

Building the Malcolm images from scratch requires Internet access to pull source files for its components. Once Internet access is available, execute the following command to build all the images used by the Malcolm appliance:

```
$ ./scripts/build.sh
```

Then, go take a walk or something since it will be a while. When you are done, you can run `docker images` and see if you have fresh images for:

* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/api` (based on `python:3-slim`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/arkime` (based on `debian:12-slim`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/dashboards-helper` (based on `debian:12-slim`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/dashboards` (based on `opensearchproject/opensearch-dashboards`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/file-monitor` (based on `debian:12-slim`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/file-upload` (based on `debian:12-slim`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/filebeat-oss` (based on `docker.elastic.co/beats/filebeat-oss`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/freq` (based on `debian:12-slim`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/htadmin` (based on `debian:11-slim`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/keycloak` (based on `quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.1`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/logstash-oss` (based on `docker.elastic.co/logstash/logstash-oss`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/netbox` (based on `netboxcommunity/netbox:latest`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/nginx-proxy` (based on `alpine:3.22`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/opensearch` (based on `opensearchproject/opensearch`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/pcap-capture` (based on `debian:12-slim`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/pcap-monitor` (based on `debian:12-slim`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/postgresql` (based on `postgres:16-alpine`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/redis` (based on `redis:7-alpine`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/suricata` (based on `debian:12-slim`)
* `ghcr.io/idaholab/malcolm/zeek` (based on `debian:12-slim`)

Alternately, if you have forked Malcolm on GitHub, [workflow files]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/tree/{{ site.github.build_revision }}/.github/workflows/) are provided that contain instructions for GitHub to build the images, as well as [sensor](live-analysis.md#Hedgehog) and [Malcolm](malcolm-iso.md#ISO) installer ISOs. The resulting images are named according to the pattern `ghcr.io/owner/malcolm/image:branch` (e.g., if you have forked Malcolm with the GitHub user `romeogdetlevjr`, the `Arkime` container built for the `main` branch would be named `ghcr.io/romeogdetlevjr/malcolm/arkime:main`). To run your local instance of Malcolm using these images instead of the official ones, you will need to edit your `docker-compose.yml` file(s) and replace the `image:` tags according to this new pattern, or use the bash helper script `./shared/bin/github_image_helper.sh` to pull and re-tag the images.

# <a name="Packager"></a>Pre-Packaged installation files

## Creating pre-packaged installation files

`scripts/malcolm_appliance_packager.sh` can be run to package up the configuration files (and, if necessary, the images), which can be copied to a network share or USB drive for distribution to non-networked machines. For example:

```
$ ./scripts/malcolm_appliance_packager.sh 
You must set a username and password for Malcolm, and self-signed X.509 certificates will be generated

Package Kubernetes manifests in addition to docker-compose.yml [y/N]?

Packaged Malcolm to "/home/user/tmp/malcolm_20250310_134542_2425d08b.tar.gz"

Do you need to package container images also [y/N]? n

To install Malcolm:
  1. Run install.py
  2. Follow the prompts

To start, stop, restart, etc. Malcolm:
  Use the control scripts in the "scripts/" directory:
   - start       (start Malcolm)
   - stop        (stop Malcolm)
   - restart     (restart Malcolm)
   - logs        (monitor Malcolm logs)
   - wipe        (stop Malcolm and clear its database)
   - auth_setup  (change authentication-related settings)

Malcolm services can be accessed at https://<IP or hostname>/

Do you need to package container images also [y/N]? y

Packaged Malcolm images to "/home/user/tmp/malcolm_20250310_134542_2425d08b_images.tar.xz"

To install Malcolm:
  1. Run install.py
  2. Follow the prompts

To start, stop, restart, etc. Malcolm:
  Use the control scripts in the "scripts/" directory:
   - start       (start Malcolm)
   - stop        (stop Malcolm)
   - restart     (restart Malcolm)
   - logs        (monitor Malcolm logs)
   - wipe        (stop Malcolm and clear its database)
   - auth_setup  (change authentication-related settings)

Malcolm services can be accessed at https://<IP or hostname>/
```

The above example will result in the following artifacts for distribution as explained in the script's output:

```
$ ls -lh
total 2.0G
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user  61k May 13 11:32 install.py
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 2.0G May 13 11:37 malcolm_20190513_101117_f0d052c_images.tar.xz
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  683 May 13 11:37 malcolm_20190513_101117_f0d052c.README.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 183k May 13 11:32 malcolm_20190513_101117_f0d052c.tar.gz
```

## Installing from pre-packaged installation files

If you have obtained pre-packaged installation files to install Malcolm on a non-networked machine via an internal network share or on a USB key, you likely have the following files:

* `malcolm_YYYYMMDD_HHNNSS_xxxxxxx.README.txt` - This readme file contains minimal setup instructions for extracting the contents of the other tarballs and running the Malcolm appliance.
* `malcolm_YYYYMMDD_HHNNSS_xxxxxxx.tar.gz` - This tarball contains the configuration files and directory configuration used by an instance of Malcolm. It can be extracted via `tar -xf malcolm_YYYYMMDD_HHNNSS_xxxxxxx.tar.gz` upon which a directory will be created (named similarly to the tarball) containing the directories and configuration files. Alternatively, `install.py` can accept this filename as an argument and handle its extraction and initial configuration for you.
* `malcolm_YYYYMMDD_HHNNSS_xxxxxxx_images.tar.xz` - This tarball contains the images used by Malcolm. It can be imported manually via `docker load -i malcolm_YYYYMMDD_HHNNSS_xxxxxxx_images.tar.xz`
* `install.py` - This install script can load the images and extract Malcolm configuration files from the aforementioned tarballs and do some initial configuration for you.

Run `install.py malcolm_XXXXXXXX_XXXXXX_XXXXXXX.tar.gz` and follow the prompts. If you do not already have Docker and Docker Compose installed, the `install.py` script will help you install them.
